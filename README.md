## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Kunal Sharma, a data scientist and engineer with over a decade of interdisciplinary experience across biotechnology, mechanical engineering, and AI-driven solutions. My career has spanned multiphysics simulation, infectious disease modeling, and organ-on-a-chip technologies.

Iâ€™ve lived three professional livesâ€”starting as a mechanical engineer focused on multiphysics simulations, moving into growing artificial organs using technology from microtechnology and the semiconductor industry, and now applying machine learning and AI across fields such as platform ranking, sustainability reporting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Feel free to check out my [CV](link-to-CV) and explore some of my [projects](https://github.com/kusharma?tab=repositories).
