Welcome! ðŸš€

I am Kunal Sharma, a data scientist and engineer with over a decade of interdisciplinary experience across biotechnology, mechanical engineering, and AI-driven solutions. My career has spanned multiphysics simulation, infectious disease modeling, and organ-on-a-chip technologies.

The Three Acts of My Professional Journey ðŸŽ­

**Act I: The Mechanical Engineer's Blueprint ðŸ”§**
I began my career as a mechanical engineer, mastering multiphysics simulations and tackling complex engineering challenges. My early work involved developing cleanroom processes for MoSâ‚‚ nanopore devices, conducting COMSOL simulations of ion transport and DNA forces, and designing shock protection features for 3D silicon structures. 

**Act II: Mastering organ-on-a-chip systems engineering ðŸ§¬**
During my PhD in Bioengineering at EPFL, I became a world-leading expert on developing bladder-on-a-chip models for disease modeling. I pioneered innovations in organ-on-a-chip technologies, creating preclinical tissue models to study bacterial and viral infections. My research involved using advanced confocal time-lapse imaging and building 3D organoid models, pushing the boundaries of tissue engineering and infectious disease research in urinary tract infections, tuberculosis and COVID-19.

**Act III: Accelerating Innovation Through AI ðŸ¤–**
In the final act of my journey, I transitioned to applying machine learning and AI across fields such as platform ranking, sustainability reporting, and agentic workflows. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AI-based retrieval-augmented generation workflows.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about data engineering and MLOps in Azure and Databricks.
