Welcome! 🚀

I am Kunal Sharma, a data scientist and engineer with over a decade of interdisciplinary experience across biotechnology, mechanical engineering, and AI-driven solutions. My career has spanned multiphysics simulation, infectious disease modeling, and organ-on-a-chip technologies.

I’ve lived three professional lives—starting as a mechanical engineer focused on multiphysics simulations, moving into growing miniaturized organs using microtechnology advances in tissue engineering, and now applying machine learning and AI across fields such as booking platforms ranking, sustainability reporting, and agents.

Feel free to check out my [CV](link-to-CV) and explore some of my [projects](https://github.com/kusharma?tab=repositories).
